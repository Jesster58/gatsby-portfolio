<h3> Experience </h3>

<h4> Apple, Annapolis — Genius </h4>
<h6> May 2020 – Present </h6>
As a Genius, I provide insightful advice and friendly, hands-on technical support to people in need. I quickly diagnose product issues on the spot, explaining situations with patience and compassion. I offer solutions to quickly get users up and running again. I have become accustomed to juggling more than one customer, while being respectful of their time. I fulfill Apple’s service commitment with style, speed, and skill. Finding trust of customers and coworkers alike as I offer mentorship, knowledge, and even tips and training. I am constantly striving to improve the customer experience, seek out feedback, and better myself every day.

<h4> Apple - At Home Advisor </h4>
<h6> March 2020 - Present </h6>
During the pandemic I moved to working from home as our stores were shut down. I trained in working with customers over the phone doing largely the same type of troubleshooting and setting up the same types of repairs that I would perform in store. Working from home has come with its own set of challenges that helped me to grow. I have learned to improve my focus, and work ethic. I also improved skills for troubleshooting, and aligning with customers without having the device in front of you.

<h4> Apple, Annapolis — Genius Admin </h4>
<h6> July 2015 – May 2020 </h6>
As a Genius Admin, I managed both repairs and customer relations, making sure that our service experience met customer expectations. I worked with a team of Geniuses and made sure they had the support, knowledge, and resources they needed to succeed. I was required to maintain turnaround time, complete repair tasks, and keep the Genius Room organized as new repairs and products arrived. I was in close and constant contact with management and leadership teams, sharing data about the statuses of repairs and processes.

<h4> Division of Information Technology, UMBC — Tech Support </h4>
<h6> September 2014 - July 2015 </h6>
I worked as support for this division while attending UMBC. I was responsible for maintaining a ticketing system, as well as assisting students on how to use the schools available resources. I helped to set up computers through the school device management, as well as networking printers. I was frequently working over the phone with both students and teachers to troubleshoot issues relating to the school network or school based accounts.

<h3> Certifications </h3>

Certified Apple Mac Technician
Certified Apple iOS Technician

<h3> Education </h3>

<h4> University of Maryland, Baltimore County, B.S. Information Systems </h4>
<h6> Spring 2012 - Fall 2018 </h6>

My degree focuses on the fundamentals of computers, networking, and business. I elected to take many additional courses and participated in numerous clubs and activities outside of just my regular coursework. This degree most prepared me for a role in Systems Analysis and Design, Computer Networking, or Health Care Informatics. I enjoyed attending and participating in Hack-a-thons which only furthered my knowledge of programming and version control. I helped lead an Interest Group "Create with Care" which gave back to the community, raised funds for Breast Cancer Research, as well as organized local roadside cleanups.
